[00:17.02] What's been happenin' in your world?
[00:24.52] What have you been up to?
[00:31.73] I heard that you fell in love, or near enough
[00:38.89] I gotta tell you the truth, yeah
[00:54.89] 
[00:45.68] I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake, baby
[00:49.77] Snap out of it (snap out of it)
[00:53.15] I get the feelin' I left it too late, but, baby
[00:57.10] Snap out of it (snap out of it)
[01:12.60] 
[01:00.93] If that watch don't continue to swing
[01:03.84] Or the fat lady fancies havin' a sing
[01:07.66] I'll be here waitin' ever so patiently
[01:10.99] For you to snap out of it
[01:23.49] 
[01:23.89] Forever isn't for everyone
[01:31.71] Is forever for you?
[01:46.30] It sounds like settlin' down or givin' up
[01:54.56] But it don't sound much like you, girl
[02:13.56] 
[02:00.54] I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake, baby
[02:04.90] Snap out of it (snap out of it)
[02:08.29] I get the feelin' I left it too late, but, baby
[02:12.33] Snap out of it (snap out of it)
[02:27.83] 
[02:16.10] If that watch don't continue to swing
[02:18.86] Or the fat lady fancies havin' a sing
[02:22.29] I'll be here waitin' ever so patiently
[02:26.28] For you to snap out of it
[02:38.78] 
[02:53.79] Under a spell, you're hypnotized (ooh)
[03:01.65] Darling, how could you be so blind? (Snap out of it)
[03:08.70] Under a spell, you're hypnotized (ooh)
[03:15.71] Darling, how could you be so blind?
[03:33.21] 
[03:22.99] I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake, baby
[03:26.42] Snap out of it (snap out of it)
[03:29.92] I get the feelin' I left it too late, but, baby
[03:33.71] Snap out of it (snap out of it)
[03:49.21] 
[03:37.43] If that watch don't continue to swing
[03:40.55] Or the fat lady fancies havin' a sing
[03:44.21] I'll be here waitin' ever so patiently
[03:47.43] For you to snap out of it
